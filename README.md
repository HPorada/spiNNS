## Neural network as a tool for studying dynamics of spin systems

### Introduction
The repository contains the code, datasets and trained models used in the master's thesis project, "Neural network as a tool for studying dynamics of spin systems". The project focused on implementation and analysis of autoencoders in terms of enhancing Monte Carlo simulation of XY spin system model.

### Abstract

### Datasets
Datasets were generated using the implementation of Monte Carlo simulaton of XY model for diffrent lattice sizes and temperatures.

### Dependencies
The project code and notebooks have dependencies on the following libraries and frameworks:
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed in your environment to run the code successfully.
